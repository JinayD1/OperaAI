"""Check that cited manual pages actually support the claims made about them.

The failure this defends against is a confident, plausible diagnosis attached to
page numbers that were invented. A page number is trivially easy to fabricate
and impossible to eyeball, so it gets checked mechanically.

Three-way verdict per quote, because a binary one would lie:

  VERIFIED     the quote appears in the extractable text of a cited page
  UNVERIFIABLE the cited page holds almost no extractable text - it is a
               diagram or scanned table, so text search can neither confirm
               nor refute. Common and legitimate: on the Carrier 59SC6A the
               troubleshooting flowchart on p.72 is entirely an image.
  NOT_FOUND    the cited page has plenty of text and the quote is not in it.
               This is the one that matters.

UNVERIFIABLE is not a failure. NOT_FOUND is.
