"""Parts stage: the components implicated in the repair, named the way the
manual names them.

The single hard rule here is that a part number is a fact, not a guess. An
installation manual like the Carrier 59SC6A carries a "Parts Replacement
Information Guide" that lists parts by GROUP NAME - "Gas Control Group: Burner,
Flame sensor, Gas valve" - with no numbers at all, and tells the owner to phone
a dealer with the unit's rating-plate data. A model asked for part numbers
against a document like that will happily produce plausible ones, and a wrong
part number costs a homeowner a return shipment and a day without heat.

So numbers are handled adversarially:
  - the prompt forbids inventing one
  - every number that comes back is checked against the manual's own extracted
    text and dropped if it isn't there
  - `numbers_unavailable` is decided from the manual, not from the model

Purchase links are built here in Python for the same reason: a hallucinated URL
is indistinguishable from a real one until someone clicks it.
